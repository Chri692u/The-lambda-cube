## The lambda cube
This is a implementation of different type systems in the lambda cube (λ-Cube). The implementation is based on "unboxing the lambda cube" made by Michelle Döring, Felix Moebius and Falk Schimweg.

## Implementations
Untyped - An untyped lambda calculus which performs alpha-conversion and beta-reduction.

Typed - A simply typed lambda calculus with integers and booleans.

λ2 - A typechecker for lambda2 with special type annotations for Pi-types. (The typechecker itself is not complete)

λomega - Not yet implemented

λP - Not yet implemented
